            Please plan to complete the study in one sitting. If you navigate
            away from this page or if you stop to do something else, the task
            will continue to run and you will earn a low score and we will not
            be able to capture sufficient data to assess your performance. The
            study should only take about 10 minutes. We ask that you please set
            aside other tasks and distractions until the study is over.
