            Please plan to complete the study in one sitting. If you navigate
            away from this page or if you stop to do something else, the task
            will continue to run and you will earn a low score and we will not
            be able to capture sufficient data to assess your performance. The
            study should only take about 20 minutes. We ask that you please set
            aside other tasks and distractions until the study is over.

            In this experiment we are measuring your reaction time and accuracy
            to the shoot/don't shoot decisions you make. For that reason, we ask
            that you rest your index fingers on the F and J keys at the start of
            each trial.

            You can input your response to the number judgment task however is
            most comfortable for you, but we want to make sure to get the
            cleanest measure of response time as possible.

            For the purposes of this study, you are being asked to make these decisions within a very narrow time frame. However, we fully acknowledge that in real life, police officers approach the decision to shoot with utmost caution and rarely make these decisions as quickly as you are being asked to do here. Nevertheless, there are some times in which officers must make split decisions, and it is our goal to study the factors that inform those split second decisions. Please try to do your best to respond within the time frame so that we can gather as much usable data as possible from you.
